      <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

         Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
         without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
         cardiovascular
         disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>
